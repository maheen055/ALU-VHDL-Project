# Home-Energy-Monitor-VHDL1

This repository hosts a VHDL project focused on designing a Home Energy Monitoring Controller using both combinational and sequential logic. The project demonstrates VHDL coding techniques, including Dataflow, Structural, and Behavioral styles. Key components include a 4-bit Magnitude Comparator, an on-chip Tester, and an HVAC sequential logic block. The project aims to provide practical experience with VHDL for digital circuit design, particularly in applying on-chip testing techniques and integrating new components in a hierarchical structure. This project is inspired by the ECE-124 Digital Circuits and Systems course at the University of Waterloo.
