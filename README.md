# ALU-VHDL-Project

This repository contains a VHDL project for designing a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using combinational logic. The project introduces and applies VHDL components in structural and dataflow designs. It includes step-by-step instructions and examples for creating VHDL entities, components, and architectures, as well as a seven-segment decoder, multiplexer, and adder. This project is based on the ECE-124 Digital Circuits and Systems course at the University of Waterloo and aims to provide practical experience with VHDL for digital circuit design.
